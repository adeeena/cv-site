		In parallel of my professional experience, in 2021 I translated
    <a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      The Gender Dysphoria Bible in both Hungarian and French</a>, with that I
    discovered my urge and willingness to assist on such projects.

    This is when I also started hosting my own podcast, the
